# Challenge: Emoji Translator
# Task: Create a Python program that translates a sentence into emojis. Each word in the sentence should be replaced with a corresponding emoji.
# Try to handle various edge cases and expand the set of supported emojis.

        'fun': 'üòÉ',
        # Feel free to expand this dictionary with more words and emojis. 
        # If you have a creative addition, collaborate by adding items and send a pull request on the GitHub repo.
        # The link to the repo is in the comment section below. Let's build a diverse set of emojis together!
